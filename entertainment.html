        <div class="post_date">July 27 at 8:00 PM</div>
        <div class="post_description">On his last two albums, Jason Eady earned major acclaim for his ahead-of-the-curve take on classic country, a bold departure from his earlier excursions into blues-infused Americana. Now with his sixth album, the Mississippi-bred singer/guitarist merges his distinct sensibilities into a stripped-down, roots-oriented sound that starkly showcases the gritty elegance of his songwriting.</div>

        <div class="post_date">August 3 at 3:00 PM</div>
        <div class="post_description">Mike McClure is quite arguably one of the most influential forces behind Red Dirt music. As a writer, a performer, singer, and producer, he has helped shape the music scene and become an integral part of its story. To look at the last few years of McClure’s life is to understand that there has been a life-altering awakening. It’s been a time of reckoning, renewal and growth for the artist — a five-year span that’s resulted in Looking Up, 10 tracks that find him getting sober, wrestling with insecurity, finding a new love for both himself and others, and working to understand the new light he’s found in discovering that the best moments in life come from being present.</div>

        <div class="post_date">August 30 at 9:30 PM</div>
        <div class="post_description">Hailing from Los Angeles, CA with a signature heavy emo-pop sound, Good Terms are bringing a fresh, celebratory, and cathartic vibe to the alternative music scene. Their songs combine poppy earworm melodies catchy enough to get your grandma singing along, heavy stank-face inducing riffs, emo songwriting guaranteed to get you deep in the feels, tasty boomer-approved guitar shredding, the juiciest bass playing money could buy, and filthy breakdowns so disgusting that you’ll want to take a shower after listening. In their recordings, Good Terms combines this delicious musical nectar with organic modern production & mixing, which to date has been handled entirely in-house. They blend the slick & hi-fi sounds of today with that tried and true “hell yeah brother” rock-n-roll feeling of yesterday. Even at their most polished, you’ll still always feel like you’re listening to a ripping live band.</div>
