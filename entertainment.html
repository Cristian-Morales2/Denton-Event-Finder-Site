        <div class="post_date">August 7 at 8:00 PM</div>
        <div class="post_description">On his last two albums, Jason Eady earned major acclaim for his ahead-of-the-curve take on classic country, a bold departure from his earlier excursions into blues-infused Americana. Now with his sixth album, the Mississippi-bred singer/guitarist merges his distinct sensibilities into a stripped-down, roots-oriented sound that starkly showcases the gritty elegance of his songwriting.</div>

        <div class="post_date">August 3 at 3:00 PM</div>
        <div class="post_description">Mike McClure is quite arguably one of the most influential forces behind Red Dirt music. As a writer, a performer, singer, and producer, he has helped shape the music scene and become an integral part of its story. To look at the last few years of McClure’s life is to understand that there has been a life-altering awakening. It’s been a time of reckoning, renewal and growth for the artist — a five-year span that’s resulted in Looking Up, 10 tracks that find him getting sober, wrestling with insecurity, finding a new love for both himself and others, and working to understand the new light he’s found in discovering that the best moments in life come from being present.</div>
